# Amiberry Android

[Amiberry](https://github.com/midwan/amiberry) is an Amiga emulator for ARM-based boards like the Raspberry Pi and alike.

This project tries to get it up and running on Android devices.

## Current status (see develop)

- Amiberry GUI comes up
- Emulator crashes if started via GUI
- It's possible to get emulation started for a Kickstart via code
- Missing proper dedicated UI for Android/finger input
- Still a lot of stuff to do
